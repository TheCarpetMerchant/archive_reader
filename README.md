## Latest version
You can find the latest version for Android [here](https://github.com/TheCarpetMerchant/archive_reader/releases/tag/v1.6.3). For iOS, it's on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/archive-reader-ao3/id6454961665).

## Android : How to install ?
Please make a backup of the app's data from the Settings before installing an update.
If you got the app from the Play Store, you will need to uninstall it before re-installing it from here the first time.

1) Click the [link](https://github.com/TheCarpetMerchant/archive_reader/releases/tag/v1.6.3) above and go to Assets > archive_reader.apk to download the update.
2) From your file explorer, open the downloaded .apk file.
3) Android will ask you to give permission to install external applications. Follow your system's instructions to enable this. You may have to disable Play Protect in the Play Store app.
4) Once that is done, you will be able to install the update by clicking the file once again. Click "Install" in the dialog and wait for your system to finish installing.

### I have an error : "The app could not be installed"
- Verify Play Protect is off in the Play Store app.
- In your settings, go to Apps and type in "Google Play services". Click the "Google Play services" app, go to Storage and clear the app's cache and data.
- If you got the app from the Play Store, you can also uninstall it and reinstall this one. Make sure to make a backup from the Settings to restore your data afterwards.
